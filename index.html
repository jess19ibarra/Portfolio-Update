            Hey Y'all! My name is Jessica Ibarra I'm not the most intresting person but I do know how to have a good
            time. Let's see I am 26 years young and have been living in Texas all of my life! I grew up in a hispanic
            household with wonderful parents and 2 brothers. I am the middle child, 4 years younger than my older
            brother and 18 years older than my little brother. I am lucky to have a supportive and caring family. After
            I graduated highschool in 2011 I decided to go to community college. I studied for a couple years but ended
            up sticking to working and not finish school. Fast foward to 2015 I was surpised but happy to find out I was
            pregnant. I became a mother in 2016 to the cutie in the picture. Her name is Emma and she is my pride and
            joy, my little sour patch kid. Emma is 3 going on 13... send help! Totally kidding, she is beautiful, brave,
            and brilliant. She is what keeps me going everyday and the reason I am taking this course. Most days I spend
            with family and friends. We like to have get togethers, watch sporting events, go to concerts or just have a
            good time. I love listening to a variety of music, and just jam out. I love to travel, I just wish I had
            tons of money so it could happen more often. I currently have a full time job as a Business Analyst for a
            Healthcare company. I have been working in healthcare for 7 years now. Which is why I am seeking a career
            change. This is definetly going to be challenging but im going to try my best and succeed!
